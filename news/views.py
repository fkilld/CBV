Detailed documentation for the news/views.py module.
This module defines several Django class-based views for managing News objects.
Each view is secured with LoginRequiredMixin to ensure that only authenticated users
can access the news functionalities. The views leverage Django's generic views to
simplify common operations like listing, creating, updating, deleting, and viewing
detailed content of news items.
Classes:
----------

Overall Design Considerations:
--------------------------------
- Security: By extending LoginRequiredMixin, all views enforce that only
  authenticated users may interact with the news module, thereby maintaining
  the privacy and integrity of the application.
- Maintainability: Utilizing Djangoâ€™s generic class-based views avoids redundant
  code and adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Flexibility: Each view is designed to be extendable and easy to modify, making
  it straightforward to adapt to additional requirements or changes in the data model.
- URL Handling: The use of reverse_lazy ensures that URL resolution is deferred
  until necessary, accommodating dynamic application configuration and avoiding
  circular import issues.

NewsListView:
    - Inherits from LoginRequiredMixin and ListView.
    - Purpose:
        * Display a list of news articles.
        * The get_queryset method is overridden to return news sorted by the
          published_date in descending order, ensuring the most recent news
          is shown first.
    - Rationale:
        * Utilizing ListView abstracts much of the list handling logic,
          including pagination and context management.
        * Ensuring only logged-in users can view the news list maintains data privacy.

NewsCreateView:
    - Inherits from LoginRequiredMixin and CreateView.
    - Purpose:
        * Provide an interface to create new news articles.
        * Uses a form that includes title and content fields.
    - Key Implementation Details:
        * Overrides form_valid to automatically set the author field as the
          current logged-in user.
        * Uses reverse_lazy to redirect to the news list after successful creation.
    - Rationale:
        * This pattern enforces that each created news article is associated
          with its creator, enhancing data integrity and accountability.
        * The use of CreateView simplifies form handling and validation.

"""
NewsUpdateView:
    - Inherits from LoginRequiredMixin and UpdateView.
    - Purpose:
        * Allow authors to update their own news articles.
        * The get_queryset method is overridden to restrict the update
          operations to only those news items created by the logged-in user.
    - Rationale:
        * This approach ensures that users cannot modify news articles that
          they do not own, thereby reinforcing security and data consistency.
        * It leverages Django's built-in update functionalities to reduce code redundancy.

"""

NewsDeleteView:
    - Inherits from LoginRequiredMixin and DeleteView.
    - Purpose:
        * Delete news articles.
        * Overrides the get method to bypass the traditional confirmation
          template and immediately proceed with deletion.
        * Redirects to a defined success_url after deletion.
    - Rationale:
        * Immediate deletion can streamline user interaction where a confirmation
          step is unnecessary or handled elsewhere.
        * Using DeleteView efficiently encapsulates the deletion logic while
          preserving consistency with other CRUD operations.
